    Heath Rost believes what many millennials do today, that personality matters. He realizes that what people really want is a relationship with other people, and secondly, with their business. By helping clients express their personality through their website, he helps them stand out from the competition and make a meaningful connection.

Aside from his work with Personable Media, his current philanthropic efforts are for aiding food distribution efforts in the metro area.
