    Heath Rost believes what many millennials do today, that personality matters. He realizes that what people really want is a relationship with other people, and secondly, with their business. By helping clients express their personality through their website, he helps them stand out from the competition and make a meaningful connection.

Heath is a Wartburg College graduate and Iowa native but felt the call to migrate to Colorado and launch his web firm in 2013. He’s an active member of the Arvada Chamber of Commerce and the Arvada Young Professionals, serves on the board for the Two Ponds Preservation Foundation, and is a recent graduate of the West Chamber’s Leadership Jefferson County program and is engaged in the Arvada Chamber’s Leadership Arvada class of 2018.

Aside from his work with Personable Media, his current philanthropic efforts are for aiding food distribution efforts in the metro area, and supporting the Two Ponds Preservation Foundation as they build the new outdoor schoolhouse in NW Arvada.
